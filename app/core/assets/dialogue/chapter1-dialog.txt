Malc: Dia! Quickly, follow me to the cave and take cover!<s><t>
Malc: Dia! Stay close and wait for this earthquake to stop!<s>
Malc: Whew, that was a close call! I hope mother and father are alright.
This cave sure is dark, good thing I brought our lantern with us.<s><t>
Malc: It's no use, I this boulder won't budge.
Maybe we can find another way out of this cave.<s><t>
Mysterious Voice: Heeeeellllllppppppp Meeeeeeeeeeeee!<s>

Malc: Well Dia, it looks like we have no choice, 
let's listen to the voice and get the heck out of here!<s><t>
Mysterious Voice: Thank you children for freeing me. My name is Xoyn.
I've been trapped in that crystal by an evil wizard from long ago.
As my gratitude for being free, I shall guide you out of the cave.<s>
Malc: It is our pleasure, normally we wouldn't trust a mysterious voice,
but we had no other choice. Thank you for guiding us out of here!<s><t>
Xoyn: Ahhhhhh the fresh air! The breeze! The sunlight! 
I haven't had these pleasantries in decades! **Evil Cackle**<s>
Thank you children, now that I am free from my confines, I, 
Onyx, shall continue trying to take over this treacherous
kingdom of Jewel!<s>
It took all the remaining strength I had to conjure up that little 
"earthquake" you two were so scared about in order to lure you
in and free the likes of me! **Evil Cackle** For your cooperation<s>
I have held up my deal and lead you outside of the cave and as
gratitude for setting me free, I shall let you live to see another day. 
Goodbye children, and thank you for letting my wickednes roam<s>
again! **Evil Cackle**<s><t>
Malc: Hey! Mister! Wait! What do you mean you're going to take over
Jewel! Xoyn!!!<s>
Dia, this is bad, we better go back home and tell mother and father 
what happened!<s><t>
Father: Dia! Malc! Thank the guradian you two are alright. Where did the
two of you go during the earthquake!?<s>
Malc: Papa, we ran into the cave in the forest for shelter.<s>
Father: Oh thank goodness! We were worred you two would've been crushed
by the debris falling from the Sanguine Crag.<s>
Dia: Oh papa! I'm so sorry!<s>
Father: What happened Dia? You two are okay, everything is fine!<s>
Dia: Well, when Malc and I ran into the cave we got trapped inside. 
We heard a strange voice coming from a glowing crystal. 
The crystal told us to knock it over and it would help us escape<s>
so we did!<s>
Father: Oh Dia! Please don't tell me... you both found the crystal
imprisoning the evil conquerer Onyx?<s>
Dia: Yes, but how did you know!?<s>
Father: My dear children, gather around while your mother and I tell
you the story of how we came to live where we are and who our family 
really is.<s><t>
